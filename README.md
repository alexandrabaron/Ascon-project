This project focuses on the study and implementation of a simplified system of 
security: the ASCON128 encryption algorithm. Designed to meet the needs 
confidentiality in data exchanges, ASCON128 is an effective solution 
to secure communications. In this report we will explore the principles 
fundamentals of this algorithm, in detail, using the description language 
SystemVerilog hardware.
